#### Being curious about why one text editor was favored over another, I would download each text editor just to be able to compare. I can’t say that I’ve found an absolute favorite yet. But choosing a text edit ends up being a very personal choice, as personal as the sports teams you support.

## ***What is a text editor?***
- A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

- A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.

## *Third-Party Options*
Ok, what about third-party options? Let’s talk about software like: Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. These text editors can all be downloaded and installed to your computer from their respective websites. Each of these titles do have some if not all of the features that we talked about earlier, and most of this software is absolutely free! They are widely used in web development today.

BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30- day free trial. After the 30 days is over, if you still want the free
version, simply continue using BB Edit, and you’ll get the same features as you would have gotten in TextWrangler. If you want the full features in BB Edit, the full cost for a full license is $49.99. Find out more by **clicking** [here](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) .

```It would be so interesting to hear what some of you are using for your text editor. Please share and let us know which text editor is your favorite and why. Let’s make this a nice robust list of our favorite text editors for all of us who are new to web development.
