# How Computers Work.!

`A computer is a programmable machine. The two principal characteristics of a computer are: It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).`

> All general-purpose computers require the following hardware components:

- Memory: enables a computer to store, at least temporarily, data and programs.
- Mass storage device: allows a computer to permanently retain large amounts of data. Common mass storage devices include solid state drives (SSDs) or disk drives and tape drives.
- Input device: usually a keyboard and mouse, the input device is the conduit through which data and instructions enter a computer.
- Output device: a display screen, printer, or other device that lets you see what the computer has accomplished.
- Central processing unit ( [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) ): the heart of the computer, this is the component that actually executes instructions.
- In addition to these components, many others make it possible for the basic components to work together efficiently. For example, every computer requires a bus that transmits data from one part of the computer to another.

> How Computers Work: Binary & Data?

+ Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data. ... Binary numbers are made up of binary digits (bits), eg the binary number 1001. The circuits in a computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors . A transistor is a tiny switch that is activated by the electronic signals it receives.
