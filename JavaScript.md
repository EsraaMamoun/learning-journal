## Introduction:
At work, when people look at my screen and see it full of code, it's not unusual to get a comment about it looking very complicated or how clever I must be to understand it. The truth is, it's not that hard to learn how to write web pages and read the code used to create them; you certainly don't have to be a "programmer."
> Understanding HTML and CSS can help anyone who works with the web; designers can create more attractive and usable sites, website editors can create better content, marketers can communicate with their audience more effectively, and managers can commission better sites and get the best out of their teams.

## How Pages Use Structure
`The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.`
Now think about a very different type of document — an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick. Again, the structure is very similar online.

> Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
>> You will commonly come across the following types of links:
>>> - Links from one website to another.
>>> - Links from one page to another on the same website.
>>> - Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page.
>>> - Links that open in a new browser window.
>>> - Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone.

# Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page
```
If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar
technique.
As long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page.
Therefore, the href attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
```
