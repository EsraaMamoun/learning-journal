## growth mindset

The growth mindset is very important to creativity, possibility, and to achieve to your own goals :+1: .

## How to keep yourself in a _growth mindset_?
#### 1. ***Challenges:***
##### Here’s an example of when I wasn’t in the right mindset: learning Java. I studied a bit of Java at university, and have worked with it in almost every role I’ve had (including my current gig as a developer on [Jira-Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/) ), and yet I still find it hard to get my head around.

#### 2. ***Success of others:***
##### My team inclydes some of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with. But I ~~didn’t always~~ think this way.

#### 3. ***Obstacles.***
