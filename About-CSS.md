> ## In this section, we will look at how to make your web pages more attractive, controlling the design of them using CSS.

`CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.`

> ### We should be learning the different *properties* we can use:
>> - Introduce you to how *CSS* works.
>> - Teach you how to write *CSS* rules.
>> - Show you how *CSS* rules apply to "HTML" pages.

::: warning
- Why we are use the `CSS`? :-( 8-)
   * CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
   + Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
   - Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
